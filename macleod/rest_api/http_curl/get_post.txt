http client can send data to http server along with http request.

1. submitting form
2. setting an options on data to be returned
3. thorugh api interface

For GET data is usually through query string 
https://www.google.com/?q=golang   is example

query.go is get example

r.URL.Query() ==> refer "net/url" also but not required to import. 
for k, v := range r.URL.Query() {
    fmt.Printf("%s %s\n", k, v)
}


for POST data is usually through body

r.Method == "POST"
body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(req.Body)
fmt.Println(body)

pattern of post request curl -si -X POST -d "some data to send" http://localhost:8080/hello/

Also check w.Write and w.WriteHeader  ==> check via go doc http responsewriter
