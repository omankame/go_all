lets say you have created your program under /home/test

# go install 

it generates error

TO fix it ===> ex. export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin  
               export GOBIN=/home/macleod/bin/
now go and check bin directory

go build ==> similar to go install only create binary locally
 
go run main.go ==> 

type inference 
var age = 20  ==> here go will detect age as int automatically. i.e type inference

basic types available in go
bool
Numeric Types
int8, int16, int32, int64, int
uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uint
float32, float64
complex64, complex128
byte
rune
string

byte is an alias of uint8
rune is an alias of int32

The value of a constant should be known at compile time. Hence it cannot be assigned to a value returned by a function call since the function call takes place at run time.
